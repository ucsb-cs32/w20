CS32 Review Session W20

Logistics:

- TO BE ANNOUNCED

Format:
- In the past
  - Short answers
  - "Briefly describe" questions
  - Write code
  - Fill in the blanks / complete the table
  - T/F; if false, explain why
  - Given a piece of code, what is the output?

Topics:

- Will cover everything from the start of the quarter up to Tuesday (3/9)

Covers lecture, labs, homeworks, and readings

- Use lecture notes as breadth of topics and all other course material as depth.

- Makefile, flags, and $^, $@
- STL (vectors, maps, unordered_maps, strings, iostream, ...)
- Know the libraries and methods discussed in lecture.
  - for example, set's [] vs .insert()

- Class design
    - ADT
    - Build process
    - Big three
    - Scope resolution operator (::)
    - Templates

- Structs and classes
    - Differences
    - Memory model, hex notation
    - Syntax

- Namespaces
    - Naming collisions
    - Global namespace

- Quadratic sorting
    - Main ideas
    - algorithms
    - optimizations
    - Running time

- Hashtables
    - Performance and functionality of hashtables
    - Open-address/double/chained-hashing
    - STL implementation (unordered_map), also know std::set, std::map, and differences

- Mergesort and quicksort
    - algorithm/running time/pros/cons

- Inheritance
    - Concepts and behavior
    - memory allocation of base/sub classes
    - Class hierarchies

- Polymorphism
    - Concepts and behavior in various scenarios
    - virtual and non-virtual
    - pure virtual, abstract classes
    - virtual destructors

- Exceptions
    - try/catch/throw - syntax and flow control
    - inherited types

- Testing
    - Understand main ideas of testing and terminology
    - tddFuncs way of testing

- OS Concepts
    - Role of the OS
    - OS Kernel
    - Relationship between software and hardware
    - Processes and threads
    - Basic UNIX commands
    - foreground vs background
    - Fork/exec

- Function pointers
    - Syntax (declare, assign, call)
    - using func pointers with threads
    - write code utilizing function pointers
    - transform

- Heap
    - Minheap and Maxheap
    - conceptual and structure
    - implementation, comparator functions
    - array representation
    - performance / Runtime analysis

- Threads
    - Concurrency / true concurrency
    - .detach() / .join()
    - Race conditions
    - Atomic operations (std::mutex)
    - In general the <thread> library, <unistd.h>
